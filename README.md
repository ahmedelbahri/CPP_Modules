# C++ (Modules 00-08)

This repository contains the solutions for the C++ modules, from **Module 00** to **Module 08**. Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ programming, from basic syntax and object-oriented programming to advanced features like STL, file handling, and more.

## About

The **C++ Modules** series provides a comprehensive learning path for mastering C++ programming. The modules cover a range of topics, from fundamental concepts like variables and loops to more advanced topics such as memory management, data structures, and algorithm optimization.

## Installation

To compile and run the C++ programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedelbahri/cpp_modules.git
    cd cpp-modules
    ```

2. Compile the C++ files using a compiler like g++:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -o program_name source_file.cpp
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```
